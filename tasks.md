TODO:


- make all components in /boekingen responsive.
- "Klantprofiel bekijken" doesn't redirect right
- Calendar day needs to hold at least 4 items, the fifth needs to be "Zie meer boekingen.." and open an overview for that day.
- add margin to the bottom of "uitloggen" button on sidebar layout
- some sort of soft switch when switching between filters and listview/calendar


## last
- move ./src/routes/dashboard/funcs/ to save location (somewhere in lib)
- change all "../../lib" to "$lib"
- test caching and if there's a great loading speed advantage adopt it (redis?)
